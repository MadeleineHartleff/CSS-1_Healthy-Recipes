# Healthy Recipes

This project is a CSS-based styling exercise for a recipe website. The webpage includes 
modifications to element sizes, fonts, colors, and styles using CSS selectors. The goal 
is to enhance the readability and visual appeal of the recipe content.

## Credits

This project is based on an exercise from 
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css-introduction">Codecademy</a>. 
While the task description and the index.html file were provided by Codecademy, 
the CSS file and its styling were fully implemented by me.
